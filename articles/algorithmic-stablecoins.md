# What are algorithmic stablecoins?

Let's assume that you are storing your money in `collateralized` non-algorithmic stablecoin. What does it mean is the company which stays behind it has potentially some reserves in real money. What if something bad happen and all of that company's treasury would be frozen? Well, price would start dropping and your money would be gone. That is where algorithmic stablecoins coming in. Basically, the difference between those two is that algorithmic stablecoins dont have any associated collateral.

The smart contract manages token supply, so it influences the token rate. The program decides to burn or mint tokens depending on the price. For instance, if it soars beyond one dollar, the program would start minting new tokens to increase supply. Conversely, if the price would fall below the coveted rate, the algorithm would start burning tokens to decrease the supply. We can assume that this is a truly `independent` and `decentralized` system.
